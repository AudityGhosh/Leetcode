# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem is organized into individual folders, and each folder includes the necessary `.cpp` or `.py` file to solve the problem. The solutions aim to address key algorithmic concepts, such as dynamic programming, binary search, and graph theory, and are organized for easy understanding and improvement.

## Folder Structure

Each folder is named according to the LeetCode problem number and title. Inside each folder, you'll find the following:

- **Source Code Files**: `.cpp` or `.py` files containing the solution to the problem.
- **README** : A brief description and constraints of the problem.

## How to Use

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AudityGhosh/Leetcode.git
```

### Navigate to the problem directory and run the solution:

For **Python solutions**:

```bash
python problem_name.py
```

For **C++ solutions**:

```bash
g++ problem_name.cpp -o problem_name
./problem_name
```

You can also explore each problem individually and see the approach or improvement suggestions in the respective `README` (if available).
